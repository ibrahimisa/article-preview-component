## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```js
  matchMedia("(min-width: 800px)").matches
```
returns `true` if the media query matches

```js
  domElement.contains(anotherDomElement)
```
returns `true` if `anotherDomElement` is a child of `domElement` or is the `domElement` itself.

### Continued development

This solution is currently not accessible but i will try to practice accessibility in my future projects.
